Materials:
- One square sheet of paper (approximately 8×8 inches or 20×20 cm).
- A flat surface for folding.
- Optional: A ruler for precise folds.


Instructions:
1. Prepare Your Paper
Start with a square piece of paper. If using colored paper, decide which side will be the exterior of your pencil case.

2. Create the Base Fold
Fold the paper diagonally in half to form a triangle. Crease well and unfold.

3. Fold the Corners
Bring each corner of the square towards the center point, forming a smaller square.

4. Form the Pocket
Fold the top and bottom edges of the square towards the center, similar to folding a letter. Crease each fold well and then unfold.

5. Shape the Sides
Fold the left and right edges of the paper towards the center crease. This will start to form the sides of your pencil case.

6. Tuck in the Corners
Tuck in the corners of the folded paper into each other to create a pocket-like structure.

7. Finalize the Pencil Case
Flip your origami pencil case over and carefully crease the folds to ensure it stays in place.


Customization Tips:
- Patterned Paper: Use origami paper with fun patterns like polka dots, stripes, or floral designs to add personality to your pencil case.
- Size Variations: Experiment with different sizes of paper for larger or smaller pencil cases.
- Decorative Add-ons: Add embellishments like washi tape, stickers, or stamps to personalize your pencil case.
