I get it, it's pretty tough handling some sort of pollution
not just air pollution, but light pollution, noise pollution, water pollution, soil pollution, and more i guess-

Remember! ♻️ **3Rs:**
    one for **reduce**
    two for **reuse**
    three for **recycle**

and you might wonder what the heck does this exactly means, well same me too-
thats why i took research

**- Reduce♻️:** Using or consuming resources efficiently and less in amount to minimise the waste.
    For example: 
    - Turn off lights when you're not using it, it'll help Reducing air and light pollution

**- Reuse♻️:** As the the name suggest, it means reusing items to extend the lifespan of the product.
    For example:
    - Use totebags instead of plastic bags of course
    - Similiar with using a water bottle instead of using the "plastic" ones

**- Recycle♻️:** Transforms waste materials into new products.
    For example:
    - Make your own pen/pencil holder out of a plastic bottle or sticks
